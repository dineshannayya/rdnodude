rdnodude is a command-line application. Run the command `rdnodude` without any arguments for a list of options.

A typical command to program your HEX file into your Riscduino microcontroller looks like this:

```console
rdnodude -c <programmer> -p <part> -U flash:w:<file>:i
```

For instance, to program an **Riscduino Score** connected to the serial port **COM1** with a HEX file called `blink.hex`,
you would run the following command:

```console
rdnodude -c riscduino_score -P COM1 -b 115200 -p score -D -U flash:w:objs/blink.hex:i
```
